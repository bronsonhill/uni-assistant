                    Based on your course materials for Computer Science Week 2, inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming.
                    
                    Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between the parent and child classes.
                    
                    For example, if you have a `Vehicle` parent class with properties like `speed` and methods like `accelerate()`, you could create child classes like `Car` and `Motorcycle` that inherit these features while adding their own specialized properties and methods.
                    
                    The syntax in Python looks like:
                    ```python
                    class Vehicle:
                        def __init__(self, speed=0):
                            self.speed = speed
                        
                        def accelerate(self, amount):
                            self.speed += amount
                    
                    class Car(Vehicle):  # Car inherits from Vehicle
                        def __init__(self, speed=0, doors=4):
                            super().__init__(speed)  # Call parent constructor
                            self.doors = doors
                    ```

                    Method overriding is a key concept in inheritance where a child class provides a specific implementation for a method that's already defined in its parent class.
                    
                    **How it works:**
                    1. The method in the child class must have the same name, parameters, and return type as in the parent class
                    2. When the method is called on an object of the child class, the child's version executes instead of the parent's
                    3. This enables polymorphism - where objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common parent class
                    
                    **Example in Python:**
                    ```python

                    Based on your course materials for Biology Week 1, photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy.

                    **The process occurs in two main stages:**
                    
                    1. **Light-dependent reactions** (in the thylakoid membrane):
                       - Chlorophyll and other pigments in photosystems capture light energy
                       - This energy is used to split water molecules (photolysis), releasing oxygen
                       - Energy is temporarily stored as ATP and NADPH
                    
                    2. **Light-independent reactions** (Calvin cycle, in the stroma):
                       - CO‚ÇÇ is captured and combined with a 5-carbon compound (RuBP)
                       - Using ATP and NADPH from the light reactions, the resulting molecules are reduced to form glucose
                       - RuBP is regenerated to continue the cycle
                    
                    **Key structures involved:**
                    - Chloroplasts: The organelles where photosynthesis occurs
                    - Thylakoids: Membrane structures inside chloroplasts where light reactions happen
                    - Stroma: Fluid inside chloroplasts where the Calvin cycle occurs

                    Chlorophyll plays a central role in photosynthesis. Here's a detailed explanation:
                    
                    **Structure and Types:**
                    - Chlorophyll is a green pigment molecule with a porphyrin ring structure containing a magnesium ion at the center
                    - The most common types in plants are:
                      - **Chlorophyll a**: The primary photosynthetic pigment (blue-green)
                      - **Chlorophyll b**: An accessory pigment (yellow-green)
                    
                    **Functions:**
                    1. **Light absorption**:
                       - Chlorophyll absorbs primarily blue and red light while reflecting green light (giving plants their color)
                       - Different chlorophyll types expand the range of light wavelengths that can be captured
                    
                    2. **Energy conversion**:
                       - When chlorophyll absorbs photons, electrons in the molecule become excited to a higher energy state
                       - This energy is channeled through a series of electron carriers in the electron transport chain
                    
                    3. **Photosystem organization**:
                       - Chlorophyll molecules are arranged in clusters called photosystems
                       - Photosystem I (PSI) and Photosystem II (PSII) work together in the light reactions
                       - In PSII, chlorophyll's excited electrons are used to split water molecules
                    
                    **Location in the cell:**
                    - Chlorophyll is embedded in the thylakoid membranes within chloroplasts
                    - It's organized into light-harvesting complexes that funnel energy to reaction centers
                    
                    Chlorophyll deficiency results in plants that cannot photosynthesize effectively, appearing yellow or white instead of green (chlorosis).

                    Based on your course materials for Law Week 1, precedent (also known as stare decisis) is a fundamental principle in common law legal systems.
                    
                    **What is Precedent?**
                    Precedent refers to the legal principle where judges are bound to follow previous decisions of courts at the same or higher level when deciding cases with similar facts and legal issues. In Latin, this principle is known as "stare decisis" which means "to stand by decisions."
                    
                    **How Precedent Works:**
                    
                    1. **Binding vs. Persuasive Precedent**:
                       - **Binding precedent**: Decisions from higher courts that lower courts must follow
                       - **Persuasive precedent**: Decisions that courts may consider but aren't obligated to follow (e.g., from courts in other jurisdictions)
                    
                    2. **Ratio Decidendi vs. Obiter Dicta**:
                       - **Ratio decidendi**: The binding part of a judgment - the legal principle upon which the decision is based
                       - **Obiter dicta**: Additional remarks or observations that aren't essential to the decision and don't create binding precedent
                    
                    3. **Hierarchy of Courts**:
                       - In most common law systems, a strict hierarchy determines which precedents bind which courts
                       - For example, in the UK, Supreme Court decisions bind all lower courts
                    
                    **Importance of Precedent:**
                    - Creates predictability and certainty in the law
                    - Ensures similar cases are treated alike (consistency)
                    - Promotes fairness and impartiality
                    - Allows for the gradual, evolutionary development of law

                    **Overturning or Avoiding Precedent**
                    
                    Despite the general rule to follow precedent, there are several legitimate ways courts can overturn or avoid previous decisions:
                    
                    **1. Overruling**
                    - Higher courts can directly overturn precedents set by themselves or lower courts
                    - Example: The US Supreme Court overturned *Plessy v. Ferguson* with *Brown v. Board of Education*, rejecting the "separate but equal" doctrine
                    - This typically happens when a court believes the precedent is:
                      - Clearly wrong or poorly reasoned
                      - No longer applicable to modern conditions
                      - Inconsistent with fundamental values or other established legal principles
                    
                    **2. Distinguishing**
                    - Courts can "distinguish" a case from existing precedent by identifying meaningful differences in facts or legal issues
                    - This doesn't overturn the precedent but limits its application
                    - Example: "While the precedent in Smith v. Jones involved a verbal contract for goods, our case involves a written contract for services, making the precedent distinguishable"
                    
                    **3. Transformation Through Interpretation**
                    - Courts can gradually reshape precedent by interpreting it in new ways
                    - This allows for evolution without explicitly overturning cases
                    
                    **4. Legislative Intervention**
                    - Legislatures can pass statutes that effectively overturn judge-made precedent
                    - Example: Parliament passing a law that explicitly changes a rule established by courts
                    
                    **Considerations When Overturning Precedent**
                    Courts typically consider:
                    - The importance of legal certainty and stability
                    - Whether people have relied on the existing precedent
                    - How workable the precedent has proven to be in practice
                    - Whether the original reasoning was flawed
                    
                    In most common law systems, overturning precedent is relatively rare, as stability and predictability are highly valued. This is why distinguishing is often preferred as a more subtle approach.

            This chat connects you with an AI study buddy that knows your course materials.
            
            Your study buddy can:
            - Answer questions about your uploaded materials
            - Explain difficult concepts
            - Help you understand challenging topics
            - Provide helpful examples and analogies
            
            For best results:
            - Ask specific questions
            - Upload complete course materials
            - Use this alongside practicing with flashcards

            ### Common Issues
            
            #### "No materials found" message
            If you're seeing this error even though you've uploaded files:
            
            1. Go to "Add Cards with AI" page
            2. Upload your materials again
            3. Make sure you see "Materials successfully processed" message
            4. Return to this page and try again
            
            #### Connection Issues
            Sometimes the system might experience temporary connection problems:
            
            1. Check your internet connection
            2. Wait a few minutes and try again
            3. Refresh the page
            
            #### Your study buddy doesn't know your materials
            If the AI doesn't seem to know about your uploaded content:
            
            1. Make sure you've selected the correct subject and week
            2. Try uploading your materials again with better quality files
            3. Break large files into smaller chunks when uploading
