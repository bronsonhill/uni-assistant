            Cellular respiration is the process cells use to convert glucose into energy in the form of ATP. 
            
            The three main stages are:
            1. Glycolysis: Occurs in the cytoplasm, breaks down glucose into pyruvate, produces 2 ATP and 2 NADH.
            2. Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle): Occurs in the mitochondrial matrix, completes the oxidation of glucose, produces 2 ATP, 6 NADH, and 2 FADH2.
            3. Electron Transport Chain: Located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, electrons from NADH and FADH2 flow through protein complexes, creating a proton gradient that drives ATP synthase to produce ATP.
            
            In total, one glucose molecule can yield approximately 36-38 ATP molecules.

            DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a double helix structure composed of nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains a phosphate group, deoxyribose sugar, and one of four nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, guanine, or cytosine).
            
            The structure of DNA allows for:
            1. Storage of genetic information in the sequence of bases
            2. Replication through complementary base pairing (A-T, G-C)
            3. Transcription of genetic information into RNA
            
            In protein synthesis, DNA serves as the template for RNA production (transcription), which then directs protein assembly (translation). The process follows the central dogma of molecular biology: DNA ‚Üí RNA ‚Üí Protein.
            
            This process involves:
            1. Transcription: DNA is transcribed into mRNA in the nucleus
            2. Translation: mRNA travels to ribosomes where the code is translated into a sequence of amino acids
            3. Post-translational modifications: The protein may undergo further modifications
