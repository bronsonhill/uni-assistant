When a function is called, these elements are 'pushed' onto the stack, and when a function returns, they are 'popped' off.

By facilitating virtual memory, the MMU enables a system to use more memory than is physically available, which is essential for executing large applications efficiently.

In user mode, processes run with limited privileges, which means they can't perform tasks that affect the control or security of the entire system, such as accessing hardware directly. This mode prevents applications from accidentally or maliciously damaging the system. In contrast, kernel mode allows the operating system, including its core kernel functions, to run with full privileges, accessing any resource on the system. This distinction is crucial for system stability and security.

The process begins with a user program placing a system call number in a register and executing a TRAP instruction, which switches the mode from user to kernel. In kernel mode, the system identifies the requested service by examining the system call number, then dispatches the appropriate system call handler. After the operation is completed, control returns to the user program.

Its primary role is to keep track of the memory address of the next instruction that is to be executed in a program. During each cycle of CPU operation, the PC fetches the instruction from memory, which is then decoded and executed.
